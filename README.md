<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [Event Harbor] <a name="about-project"></a>

Event Harbor is a dynamic Full Stack event management web application, showcasing a sophisticated front-end developed using React. Users can effortlessly add, update, and delete events through an intuitive and responsive interface. The project is intricately designed with TailwindUI and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a visually appealing and modern user experience.

Behind the scenes, the back-end API powers the application, built with Ruby on Rails and supported by a PostgreSQL database. The API, residing in a separate repository, seamlessly integrates with the React front end, offering a comprehensive solution for managing events.

As an ongoing project, Event Harbor is committed to delivering a seamless and feature-rich event management experience. Stay tuned for updates and improvements as we continue to refine both the React front end and the Ruby on Rails API.
